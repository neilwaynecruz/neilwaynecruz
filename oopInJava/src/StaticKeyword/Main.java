package StaticKeyword;
/* static = is a keyword. This means that a variable or method belongs to the class itself,
                    rather than to a specific instance (object) of the class.

                    Static variables are shared among all objects of a class.
                    Changing the value in one place updates it for all instances.

                    Static methods can be called without creating an object of the class.
                    They are often used for utility functions (like Math.pow()).

                    When to Use static:
                    - For constants or values shared by all instances.
                    - For utility methods that donâ€™t rely on instance-specific data.
                    - For keeping track of class-wide information.
